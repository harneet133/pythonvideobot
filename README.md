I have created a python bot that genrates videos with python much easier than anyone else code to read this done by smart work not hard work
It just inspired by codewithlewis but his version for a beginner his code was also easy but not enough for a lazy a programmer like me
So  i created this programme
It just take 5  random facts from random facts library and save it as a image and converts the facts into a text.
Then the the video converter file takes all all the audios and images and by some simple placements it convert into a video
And in final it takes audio and append it to final video file
